# Microservice_Application_with_MongoDBAtlas_AWSCDK_APIGW_Lambda

This is a reference architecture for API-based applications with MongoDB Atlas, APIGW, and Lambda

## [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas)

MongoDB Atlas is an all-purpose database having features like Document Model, Geo-spatial, TimeSeries, hybrid
deployment, and multi-cloud services.
It evolved as a "Developer Data Platform", intended to reduce the developer's workload on development and management of
the database environment.
It also provides a free tier to test out the application/database features.

## [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/)

Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor,
and secure APIs at any scale.

## [Amazon Cognito User pool](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/cognito)

Amazon Cognito User pool helps you to deliver frictionless customer identity and access management (CIAM) with a
cost-effective and customizable platform. Helps you to add security features such as adaptive authentication, support
compliance, and data residency requirements. It can scale to millions of users across devices with a fully managed,
high-performing, and reliable identity store.

1.  ## Prerequisites

    This demo, instructions, scripts, and cloudformation template are designed to be run in `us-east-1`. With a few
    modifications, you can try it out in other regions as well. Make sure to change REGION_NAME in global_args.py if not
    using US-EAST-1

    - [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) Installed & Configured
    - AWS CDK Installed & Configured
    - MongoDB Atlas Account
    - [MongoDB Atlas CDK Setup](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/atlas/deploy-mongodb-atlas-aws-cdk-typescript/).
      Please ensure only the below setup portion of this link is completed. Not needed to complete the full demo.

      a. Ensure the MongoDB organization API keys are stored in the AWS Secrets. Use the AWS
      CloudFormation [Template](https://github.com/mongodb/awscdk-resources-mongodbatlas/blob/main/examples/profile-secret.yaml).

      b. Ensure the AWS Roles are created. Use the AWS
      CloudFormation [Template](https://github.com/mongodb/mongodbatlas-cloudformation-resources/blob/master/examples/execution-role.yaml)

      c. Ensure the CloudFormation Public Extensions of MongoDB are activated in the Registry.

    - Python Packages :
    - Python3 - `yum install -y python3`
    - Python Pip - `yum install -y python-pip`
    - Virtualenv - `pip3 install virtualenv`

1.  ## Setting up the environment

    - Get the application code

      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/mongodb-partners/Microservice_Application_with_MongoDBAtlas_AWSCDK_APIGW_Lambda.git
      cd aws_mongodb_sample_dir
      ```

1.  ## Prepare the dev environment to run AWS CDK

    We will use `cdk` to make our deployments easier. Let's go ahead and install the necessary components.
    Use the link to copy MongoDB Atlas Organization ID

    ```bash
    # You should have npm pre-installed
    # If you DONT have cdk installed
    npm install -g aws-cdk

    # Make sure you in root directory
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt

    cd aws_mongodb_sample
	pip install --target ./dependencies pymongo
	cd ..

    # Set Environment Variables
    export ORG_ID="<ORG_ID>"
    export MONGODB_USER="<MONGODB_USER>"
    export MONGODB_PASSWORD="<MONGODB_PASSWORD>"

    cdk bootstrap aws://<ACCOUNT_NUMBER>/<AWS-REGION> 

    ```

    ```bash
    cdk ls
    # Follow on screen prompts
    ```

    You should see an output of the available stacks,

    ```bash
    AwsMongodbAtlasCreateStack
    AwsMongodbSampleStack
    ```

1.  ## Deploying the application

    Let us walk through each of the stacks,

    - **Stack: AwsMongodbAtlasCreateStack**

      This stack will create four resources and return Mongo Db Atlas URL

      a)    MongoDB::Atlas::Cluster

      b)    MongoDB::Atlas::Project

      c)    MongoDB::Atlas::DatabaseUser

      d)    MongoDB::Atlas::ProjectIpAccessList

    - **Stack: AwsMongodbSampleStack**

      This stack will create

      a)    Secret for storing ATLAS DB URI

      b)    Cognito User Pool for API Authentication

      c)    Lambda function that will create a database , insert dummy data and return document count

      d)    API Gateway backed by the lambda function created above

      ```bash
      cdk deploy --all
      ```

      After successfully deploying the stack, Check the `Outputs` section of the stack aws_mongodb_sample_stack, you
      will see ApiGatewayEndpoint created.

## **Test**

Navigate to the Cognito user pool and copy the User Pool ID and Client ID (App Integration tab)  from the Cognito User
pool

Open Cloud Shell and create a user with the command mentioned below

   	aws cognito-idp admin-create-user --user-pool-id  <YOUR_USER_POOL_ID>  --username apigwtest

Once the user is created since itâ€™s created by admin we will have to force change the password by running the below
command

    aws cognito-idp admin-set-user-password --user-pool-id <YOUR_USER_POOL_ID>  --username apigwtest  --password <PASSWORD> --permanent

Replace the User Pool ID and Client ID copied in the above step and also replace the user name and password of the user
created above

 	aws cognito-idp admin-initiate-auth --user-pool-id <YOUR_USER_POOL_ID> --client-id <CLIENT_ID>  --auth-flow ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH --auth-parameters USERNAME=apigwtest,PASSWORD=<PASSWORD>

Copy the ID Token created from the above step and run the below command to test the API. Copy the API_GATEWAY_ENDPOINT
from the API Gateway console --> API Gateway: APIs: ApiGateway (xxxxxx) :Stages

 	curl --location --request GET 'https://<API_GATEWAY_ENDPOINT>.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Authorization: <ID_TOKEN>'

## Creating the frontend application

Switch into the frontend project.

    cd aws_mongodb_sample/frontend

Add th URL you retrieved in the above test step to the TodoList.js script.

    const apiEndpoint = "https://o72ork5oub.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/todos";

First, you need to initialize Amplify. You can keep the default settings for this.

    amplify init

Next, we need to add hosting to the project. Choose `Hosting with Amplify Console` and `Manual deployment`.

    amplify hosting add

Whenever you make changes:

    amplify push

Finally, we can publish the frontend.

    amplify publish

## **Clean up**

Use `cdk destroy --all` to clean up all the AWS CDK resources.
Terminate the MongoDB Atlas cluster.

## Troubleshooting

Refer to [this link](https://github.com/mongodb/mongodbatlas-cloudformation-resources/tree/master#troubleshooting) to
resolve some common issues encountered when using AWS CloudFormation/CDK with MongoDB Atlas Resources.

## Useful commands

* `cdk ls`          lists all stacks in the app
* `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
* `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `cdk diff`        compares the deployed stack with the current state
* `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation

Enjoy!
